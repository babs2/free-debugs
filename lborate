CJ, I am having trouble with an API for the secretary of state website.  The docs only show ajax in javascript (I am not familiar with ajax). 
I am hoping that you can help me out since I am hoping to get that into a http website link I can use with my key.  I am providing my key for 
easier use for you.  If you decide to use this for a stream, I am trying to lookup businesses that have closed up, and are no longer in business 
according to the SOS.  Love the channel!!  

Brian.
